This repository keeps track of the testing being done on a multi-layer perceptron trained on handwritten digits (MNIST dataset).I am new to deep learning and wanted to play around with the code.

The `ann1HL.py` and `ann3HL.py` files are adapted from a piece of code written in `MATLAB` for an 2nd year undergrad project. They MLPs with one hidden layer and three hidden layers respectively.
